So as you all know on 22nd April this year Pakistani Terrorist attacked Indian Tourist and killed those who belonged to Hinduism. In response India carried out airstrikes on TERROR CAMPS inside of POJK and Pakistan itself on 7th May. This time the videos were all across X (aka twitter), and Pakis were releasing proof themselves. US president yesterday wrote a post on X that with his intervention and mediation both parties have agreed on ceasefire. But Pakis are dogs which again attacked and Indians then attacked to their Nur Khan Airbase and others. 

So I also want to update about myself. I have been taking steps to improve my health. I have taken steps towards studying for RHCSA although I won't lie, I have been lazy for few days and I have been commiting sins of relapsing. I have learner's license test on 15 I haven't studied for it too. I have to improve. I will delete youtube right now from my phone. Yes I reinstalled it thinking I will watch only educational content and I got stuck into endless loop of watching youtube shorts. I take full responsibility of my irresponsible actions that don't add value to me, actions which my future self will frown upon. Thank You.
