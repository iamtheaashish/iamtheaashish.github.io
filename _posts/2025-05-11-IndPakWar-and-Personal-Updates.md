So as you all know on 22nd April this year Pakistani Terrorist attacked Indian Tourist and killed those who belonged to Hinduism. In response India carried out airstrikes on TERROR CAMPS inside of POJK and Pakistan itself on 7th May. This time the videos were all across X (aka twitter), and Pakis were releasing proof themselves. US president yesterday wrote a post on X that with his intervention and mediation both parties have agreed on ceasefire. But Pakis are dogs which again attacked and Indians then attacked to their Nur Khan Airbase and others.
