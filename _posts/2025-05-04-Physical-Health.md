Health was never my priority for last 2 years as I was not healthy mentally due to burden of studies which I never liked. Although now I am loving what I do so I have enough amount of time to focus on health. I don't have to become a gym freak right now. I just want to stay healthy enough to survive. 

I have to focus on flexibility, endurance and muscle strength. I am not regular but now I have to do progression in terms of my health. Just before writing this post, I was following Movement by David full body stretch. I had previously done CORE workout in afternoon.

Right now goal is PROGRESSION not PERFECTION in every realm of life.
