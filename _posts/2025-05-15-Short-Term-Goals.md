I want to update about a lot of different things happening in my life. Okay so I passed 12th with a percentage no one was expecting 78% (best 5), good. I cleared Learner License test on 15 March 2025, and what I saw while on the way will always remain with me. I saw wealth in rich areas of Delhi. I don't know whenever I go to some rich place, I always find out wealth. For example when I went to IGI airport on 29 March 2025, I saw wealth; high buildings, airplanes so close (beautiful piece of machines), cars that I didn't even knew they existed in India like BYD which is a chinese electric car company and it had haryana's number plate. I had audacity to get my pictures clicked near expensive restaurants but no money to buy stuff from there. But one day I will have.

When second,third and fourth picture were being clicked, a CISF soldier warned us that we are blocking way to the washroom. He was on a vehicle and with a LMG. ðŸ˜…
I will remember this story. I do have many of my pictures at IGI but I don't want to use all up my GitHub storage. But it was fun. Whenever I remember that day, it reminds me of getting more valuable and more powerful to afford a luxury of being at those places whenever I like.

My journey begins with earning money and investing in right things, for that I need a high paying job. To get a high paying job, I need to work hard in a thing which I like (Linux). I have been using Linux when covid started because it was light on resources and I had 4gb ram. And I have lately felt I really like solving problems in terminal. When I start feeling Linux inside me, when I start feeling Linux as a part of my body or soul, that's when I will start making money with it. RHCSA is a certification which is like a door pass for me for getting into this field. End goal is RHCA. To reach that level I have to clear RHCSA, RHCE and 5 other certifications from Red Hat. Also I have to do certifications related to cloud. Looks like I am moving towards being a DevOps Engineer. But I myself don't know about my future. What I know is I have to work hard in Linux and get certifications after certifications and enhance my skills. But not only technical skills, I also have to work on my communication skills. ENGLISH ANGREZIII, I have totally forgotten about grammar rules but my instincts are very strong, I instantly sense something is wrong with this sentence. My vocabulary is decent but it should be outstanding. I can read some of the most complex words with ease. I can understand almost all type of acsents (don't know the spelling, so pardon me). But I accept, as of now I do have problems while speaking. I stuck and stammer while speaking. I cannot speak words like temporarily for some reason. That's why I have started to upload my progress on YouTube as well which for atleast now I won't release for general public. This simple tasks is meant to improve my conversation in long term.

I am going to do BCA from IGNOU, and I am going to compete with B.Tech CSE students from top colleges. I have to outsmart and outperform them otherwise there is no place for me in this world.

21 July 2025 is my hypothetical date for scheduling RHCSA exam.I have to buy exam voucher
