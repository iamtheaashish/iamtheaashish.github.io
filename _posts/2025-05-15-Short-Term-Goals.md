I want to update about a lot of different things happening in my life. Okay so I passed 12th with a percentage no one was expecting, good. I cleared Learner License test on 15 March 2025, and what I saw while on the way will always remain with me. I saw wealth in rich areas of Delhi. I don't know whenever I go to some rich place, I always find out wealth. For example when I went to IGI airport on 29 March 2025, I saw wealth; high buildings, airplanes so close (beautiful piece of machines), cars that I didn't even knew they existed in India like BYD which is a chinese electric car company and it had haryana's number plate. I had audacity to get my pictures clicked near expensive restaurants but no money to buy stuff from there. But one day I will have.
