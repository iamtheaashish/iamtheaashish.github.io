Very few people actually listen to me. You, who is reading this blog is one of them. Lines I write here can contain grammatical mistakes which proves I don't use AI. Even though I have used it to write title date categories tags. See I don't lie.

Let me update you with what's really going on. Last month was quite unproductive and unhealthy. I tried Exercising consistently but failed. I was confused with 5 W's of what am I supposed to do in this field. How do I get started, what's the first step. Whole month I spent getting overview of the IT field. Now I believe I have a clear path. Any IT field requires you to have knowledge of Networking, Linux and understanding programming.

Life: Life is stagnant I shall say. My parents want to waste money on JBT, which I don't want them to waste money on. So yesterday I said them instead of wasting your money please fund my RHCSA certification which is necessary for me to have as a starting point in my IT career. They refused. They said we'll only fund BCA. Good for now. 12th board results are not even out now and I know so much, no one of my age from my school would have knowledge to use GIT, Docker and tHe gReaT LINUX. But I know nothing compared to professionals who make money. Let's discuss about career. 

Career: Toh merko ek chiz smjh aa chuki hai. That first step is to master Networking and Linux and C language is an addon or adon whatever it is called. On 29 April 2025 a book arrived and it is called "Data Communications and Networking with TCP/IP Protocol Suite" by an author named Behrouz A. Forouzan. So I have read till Physical Layer. I will read further and understand concepts. I want to be as competent as possible because my competition is with B.Tech Computer Science Engineering students. It's as if a Maruti Suzuki Alto competing Toyota Fortuner. So I will have to learn constantly and never stop. I have downloaded few books to also learn about LINUX. I have again changed my operating system from Kali to Debian. Atleast next 2-3 months will go towards mastering these 3 things. 

Health: Health is wealth. I have to save my wealth so I have downloaded MOD APK for "Home Workout- No equipments". Lol I have committed a cybercrime even before entering the cybersecurity field. I am a blak hat lol. üßë‚Äçüíªüíªüêöüîê
