Very few people actually listen to me. You, who is reading this blog is one of them. Lines I write here can contain grammatical mistakes which proves I don't use AI.

Let me update you with what's really going on. Last month was quite unproductive and unhealthy. I tried Exercising consistently but failed. I was confused with 5 W's of what am I supposed to do in this field. How do I get started, what's the first step. Whole month I spent getting overview of the IT field. Now I believe I have a clear path. Any IT field requires you to have knowledge of Networking, Linux and understanding programming.

Life: Life is stagnant I shall say. My parents want to waste money on JBT, which I don't want them to waste money on. So yesterday I said them instead of wasting your money please fund my RHCSA certification which is necessary for me to have as a starting point in my IT career. They refused. They said we'll only fund BCA. Good for now. 12th board results are not even out now and I know so much, no one of my age from my school would have knowledge to use GIT, Docker and tHe gReaT LINUX. But I know nothing compared to professionals who make money. Let's discuss about career.
