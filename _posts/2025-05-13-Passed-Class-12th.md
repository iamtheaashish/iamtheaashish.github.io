Your king AASHISH wanted to announce to his people of Kingdom Of Bkchodpur that he has successfully passed class 12th CBSE Board science, not only passed but also topped in whole universe with 78% marks (excluding chemistry). I want to tell that I never wanted to study science. Actually I never wanted to study anything, I find conventional way of education really boring. I know I am getting outside the context of the post but I am the king over here. I like to learn by doing things. For example to write this simple blog, I use VS CODIUM (not code) and somehow to post this post, I can't post it by using some gui, so I had to learn to use git using terminal. Again, I like to learn to do things by doing them and not memorizing them.

That's what I don't like about conventional way of learning. They indirectly taught me to make trinitrotoluene aka tnt on paper but never actually performed the experiment. In physics they had some useless experiments to calculate a variable from the data, write bullshit theory. They never tried to engineer something, not even a RC Car. Students in India want to crack Jee mains and advance or NEET just to get into IIT's and AIIMS' not to become the greatest engineer or doctor.

Well this is coming from a person who failed in class 11 in physics and biology and passed in compartment exam, obviously he's the king of bkchodpur, his highness King Aashish Raj Singh. So I have no right of judging or complaining about system, I was born to make MY life valuable and worth it, not others. Chapter of school life is now officially over for me, yes I was forced to study what I never wanted to study, yes I used to feel like a prisioner in school and I was completely a different person inside the school, yes I my mental and physcial health deteriorated in these 2 years of 11th and 12th. But if I continue to remind myself of these things that happened in past 2 years, I will always feel myself as a victim, and your courageous King is a warrior, warriors don't feel like a victim they move on onto their next exploit. I am king of bkchodpur right now, I want to conquer lodipura. I shall not focus on battlescars I got while conquering bkchodpur.

I want to be the most victories, most wealthiest king of my lineage. That's all. That's the goal. I don't know the path, we'll find out.

I began writing this post on 13th. 11:30 and electricity went down and it's 14th. Tomorrow I have Learner License Test. Baate krte krte kahi aur nikal gya marks toh btaye hi nhi.
so here is the screenshot:

I have hidden my board roll number and my parents name for obvious reasons, I am the king, all attention shall be towards the king.

I had never thought I would even pass physics after giving the exam. I calculated my marks after coming home, and it was 14.5 roughly, far below 23.5 . And mind you I got 42 marks in physics. I even got 42 in Biology for which I had studied a lot. HOW? IDK good thing is I passed and my parents were not expecting 78% but they are happy.
