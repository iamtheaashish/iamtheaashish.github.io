To be honest, my mindset has never been so great. But my actions are not so great. I haven't defined what my long term, mid term and short term goals are for the year. So after publishing this post I will sit down to journal what I have to do this coming week, this coming August and what are my expections from this year.

Well this month was spent in learning Linux. Everything except for the networking and firewall stuff has been completed. I need to read "Data Communications and Networking with TCP/IP Protocol Suite" first inorder to understand networking in Linux properly, the coming month I will read. 

I am proud of myself that this month I have committed equally towards my health and I have started gyming. I can do 20 pushups in a row. 

Coming 90 Days are going to be great for me.
