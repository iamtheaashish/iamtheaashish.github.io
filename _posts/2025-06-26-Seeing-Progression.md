So I am seeing progression in my system administration skills in Linux. It's only this week when I have truly felt happy with myself. Question is how? I was highly unproductive just a week ago. It's simply because that I started bathing two times a day, in morning and before going to sleep at night. Why am I following this type of schedule? I want to maintain my state of purity; Brahmcharya. I want to let go excessive heat which promotes me to ejaculate without the purpose of creating life (self destruction). As of now I am watching Nehra Classes free playlist and practicing side by side whilst watching. It was only yesterday I came offtrack. Yesterday was Axiom 4 launch, 2nd time an Indian going to space, so it was pretty historic, so I started watching mission's live stream. Tech was fascinating. After the live stream was over, I started downloading Patalok S1, 24 GB, then I had to wait for it to complete, I was watching podcast "Flying Beast with Prakhar ke Pravachan". I am seeing progression but I want to keep it consistent.
