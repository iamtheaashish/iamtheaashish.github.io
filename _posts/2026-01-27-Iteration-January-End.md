This month has been the most amazing month. I can brag about it all day, however progression is never ending and I would like to make a lot of changes in myself this year. I am defining those changes slowly as I get to know about them myself.

[26 January 2026 Physique](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Bu3Qwn3DHmg)
So this is me on 26 Jan 2026, I keep shaving my head because I like it. I try to exercise consistently but I never do. On an average you can say I have exercised every 5th day in an year. That's not good specially when I am living in Delhi. In the video you can see my skinny fat body, belly fat is visible. I don't want to set a goal that is pure imagination, but something that is more managable.

Okay 100 Pushups, 100 Squats, 100 Situps, 100 Neckraises, 500 Jumping Jacks every alternate day. I am going to keep track of it in my journal.

I sometimes watch youtube shorts endlessly. And the amount of time that I am wasting is ludicrous. Let me show you some stats.

So to social media, I am limiting myself to just 2 hours a day.

Secondly I want to spend more time reading. Whether it is tech books or self improvement. They are going to improve my vocab
