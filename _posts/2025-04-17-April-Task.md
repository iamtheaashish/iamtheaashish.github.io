Hello, So yesterday I made this github blog and learnt to use git. And I believe it's a great thing to journal over here than in the notebook or journal. This permanently saves my words. Well Well. My name is Aashish and I was born on 3 August 2006, officially or legally born on 3 April 2007. I am 18 years old at the moment. I am lower middle class right now. But soon I want to come in upper middle class segment of the society. Right now I don't get money for GYM from my parents. And I don't and will not blame for my circumstances but I will blame them for making me study science in class 11 and 12 even when I refused. I am 18 and I have to figure everything out myself. What's my networth today on 17 April 2025. I have this computer worth ₹25k , I have this table on which the computer sits and relaxes (it was free for me as Ankit mama gave it), I have ₹30 in the drawer of the table. And nothing else. The question is do I want to die in the same way. Probably not. I want to be rich enough that I never have to think about not having enough money. Money and Power are co-related. Money gives Power and Power gives Money. I don't have luxurious thoughts currently. But for sure if I earn enough money, my life is going to be better than before. I could afford a premium gym membership, a good diet, clothes that would fit.

Anyways, to become rich, I should have a business, to start a business I should have money, to have money I should be skilled and smart. I'll have to work for someone before making people work for me and paying them. Most of my time should go in skilling myself up and making me smart. Now I have stepped in field of cybersecurity and there is no point of return. 

This is the line I shouldn't forget - LEARN AS IF IT'S MY JOB. I CAN'T SAY NO TO IT.

So, I have 24 hours in a day like everybody. Here's a routine I have to follow.
1. Wake up at 5.30am, Drink Water and Shit.
2. Go for a RUN and riding bike.
3. Come back, BRUSH and BATH, And wear good clothes. 7am
4. Start PROGRAMMING, first watch video and then code and build logic yourself. 11am
5. Eat Food + Business (me and devanshu have started something).
6. Bring my sister from school. 2pm
7. Complete my exercises. And eat soyabean chunks and eggs. 
8. Drop my sister tuition, come back and sleep for a bit
9. Wake up, go and bring her. Come back and start with networking. 8pm
10. Read BOOK, anything related to self help. Sleep till 10.30pm
