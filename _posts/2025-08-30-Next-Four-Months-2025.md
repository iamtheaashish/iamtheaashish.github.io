## ***What have I done in 2025 until now?***
So my 12th ended this year offcially when I passed my exams with good 'enough' marks. I scored 78% overall. These marks were because of Commercial Arts in which I scored 97 idk how. I was forced to take Biology after 10th. 2 years were horror for me. In school teachers fucked me mentally and at home parents. I had compartment in 11th which I passed eventually. Only then my parents told me to do whatever I want after 12th. By 'whatever I want' they meant that in career. They have given me roughly 1.5 years to get started. While I was in 12th, I planned to get started with web development. But it is not AI proof, still I watched leaked course of Sheriyans Coding School which my friend Devanshu arranged for me. I didn't like it much though. My friend Devanshu is a cybersecurity guy. He said me that cybersecurity can't be replaced by ai. As it requires deep logical thinking. It requires deep knowledge of tech and humans. Most attacks are done only when humans are vulnerable not when tech is. I decided to begin with cybersecurity after 12th. On 25 March 2025 my exams officially ended, last was Biology exam. On 29 March, my home got a wifi connection. On 31st March, My mini PC arrived (Other peripherals arrived before my Biology exam was done). Mini PC didn't have pre-installed OS, as I didn't asked them to put it for me. Windows is pretty common but to be honest I haven't used it for 4-5 years now. I do get option to touch it on someone else's PC but I am talking about MYSELF. I had wifi and PC on 31st but I didn't have another PC to make bootable pendrive for Kali Linux. So I waited for my Uncle's PC at his flat somewhere near to my house get free. I then went there and made a bootable pendrive for Kali Net Installer. And it took 2 hours for me to install Kali all because I choosed net installer. In-built wifi antenna of mini pc was not good enough, that's why. So kali was installed and for whole April I tossed around NETWORKING CONCEPTS, Hack The Box and Try Hack Me labs didn't understood. So watched some video and talked to people a lot. They told me a big pre requiste is LINUX. I thought I already know Linux enough, I have been using it since my 8th standard beginning. Then people said LINUX SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION, some suggested to do RHCSA certification. Now this whole part of getting certified seemed interesting to me. So I digged YouTube and found out a channel named ***KR Network Cloud***, they also had another channel named ***Linux Wale Guruji***. While walking in evening in my home's terrace I would listen to his videos. He inspired me to become RHCA Red Hat Certified Architect. I didn't even know what it does but I was inspired and from his channel only I heard about this term DevOps. Somehow I searched for free Linux training on youtube. I found out Nehra Classes. From there I learnt Linux. 80% I have learnt, 20% is left, and 100% practice is still left. On and Off I have been reading Networking book. I have been interacting with people of LinkedIn and I have also made a friend whos name is Shaik Ashish. He guides me, he is RHCA. I love the way he troubleshoot problems. I can watch him for hours troubleshooting problems while practice. Anyways, I have understood, not mastered, Linux, Shell Scripting, C language, Operating Systems, Networking basics and AWS Cloud. 

August is over, September will start tomorrow. Just 4 months are left. September, October, November and December finally.  

***
## ***What should I accomplish in these 4 months?***
1. ***Linux Troubleshooting ~ Advanced Level***  
I want to be so good in Linux that I can troubleshoot essentially every single error. I want to know more than people who are certified. I want to know in and outs of Operating Systems.  
+ Learn `Server Configuration` and `Ansible` also.
2. ***Understanding of Detailed Networking***  
In IT both human and computer networking is important. I have been ignoring it for most of my journey. But Shaik Ashish said that there will be certain topics which you won't like but you'll either ways have to learn them in order to become GREAT. I have to read `Data Communication and Networking with TCP/IP Protocol Suite` by Behrouz A. Forouzan.
3. ***BCA Semester-1 Syllabus***  
Maths syllabus is vast. Rest I can manage. I have to only study enough to pass with average score.
4. ***C Programming + DSA with Python***  
C programming to understand programming deeply first, then DSA with Python to increase my scripting logic. Python will be using in DevOps scripting.
5. ***DBMS from Gate Smashers***  
DevOps engineer should understand basic DBMS. For that I have to complete DBMS by Gate Smashers.
6. ***AWS Solutions Architect Level Training***
I want to be better than those who have certification. I can have certification but can definatly have Solution Architect level knowledge. I have Shaik Ashish who will help me understand .
7. ***Other DevOps Tools***  
        1. Git - read `Pro Git` book.  
        2. Honestly I don't know much about them right now. I shall read all the books related to DevOps and understand what tools and technologies to keep in my arsenal. 
***
> DevOps will help me earn money. That money will fund my experiments/projects/businesses to ***stop climate change***. By giving my parents money, they'll let me live my life peacefully. I would be able to focus on my goal. 
***
So I will keep updating this blog to define my next month's objectives over here. I will also have a physical copy of these objectives in front of my computer desk to remind me. Along with getting strong mentally, I also have to focus on becoming physically strong, so it's a shame for me to skip daily workout. I shouldn't have time for BEKAAR kI CHIZE. This world can no longer support *mediocre people*.
