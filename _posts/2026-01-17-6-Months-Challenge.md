I am writing this myself and not AI, ignore some of my mistakes. I don't want to make my brain slop by AI BRAIN ROT. ;D
I have been watching a youtube channel for a while. It's called 'Chai aur Code' and it's by a person named Hitesh Choudhary. I really like the advice he gives.
His advice has not only helped me in tech but life aswell. So he has started a cohort, Full Stack Web Development. It costs a lot, even if it had costed less, I wouldn't have purchased it either. I don't want to go into Full Stack Web Development. 

In 6 months, Hitesh and his team is going to teach their students Full Stack (meaning Front-end and Back-end both), it will take them 6 months to complete their curriculum. If they can do it, I can too, but alone.

## Then what is the challenge?
I want to learn Back-end development and DevOps, and I want to implement back-end in C++. C++ is itself a very hard programming language, I don't know how hard will it be to implement backend in C++. But I will commit to C++. Later I will learn GO programming language which is more common in backend than C++.

Challenge is that I will be a better Back-end + DevOps Engineer than anyone in their cohort after 6 months. It is a personal challenge. It is a fight with myself.
I am learning C++ from learncpp.com, I am making my networking fundamentals strong by "Data Communications and Networking with TCP/IP Protocol Suit by Behrouz Forouzan" and I have also ordered "Silberschatzs Operating System Concepts 10Ed Global Edition", how ever I understand operating systems, Linux is my strongest point, still to become a better backend engineer I should make my fundamentals very strong. I also have to learn Database, I will order that book later. 

As of Jan 2026
I have learnt all the major/basic services of AWS CLOUD from videos shared by my Late Friend Shaik Ashish. If I had money, would have cleared RHCSA. I learnt Git from 'Pro Git' book, I learnt deployment servers like tomcat/nginx/httpd from videos Shaik Ashish gave me. I learnt Sonatype Nexus (to store artifacts in remote repo) and SonarQube for code quality again from videos by Late Shaik Ashish. He was a great person and is a great soul.

I am currently learning Docker and will eventually learn other tools by reading book, lectures are slow and are designed to be easy to consume. They don't go into depths. So I am learning Docker from "Docker Deep Dive".

In 6 months, I will write another blog on 17 July 2026 to update my progress.

So Hitesh sir also shared an adivce which I am going to follow. That is writing/typing down your thoughts on paper/screen. That will help me become a better communicator.
Secondly, I am only going to do one topic a day and not try to rush over. I won't do extra. I will maintain consistency.

I am eating too much sugar and too much junk. I need to stop it, it is reducing my effective time on Earth. It is slowing me down. I am not exercising daily also.
I am eating a lot of CARBS FATS and not enough PROTEIN. Also I am using a little EXTRA social media. I should use it during a particular window, i.e. only half n hour before 2pm.
I am also listening way too much music, singers self fallacy, when I listen to it, I am believing (for that duration of song) that I am successful, however I am not. 
So here things I don't have to do: 
1. Don't just depend on sugar and carbs, take enough protein.
2. Don't stay lazy and sloppy, exercise.
3. Don't use social media at any time of the day.
4. Don't listen to music, stay calm.

I am stopping live streams I am doing. Too much for my PC. Maybe my idea was to study infront of someone so I do the work, but now I am realising that I should be able to do the work when no one is watching. I am also thinking to start a new agency which builds android apps for businesses. But android development in Kotlin, not in React Native.
But I am not running away from learncpp.com. I will finish learncpp then move to kotlin or go. DOn't know but it will happen. I need to stop eating before 12 pm . Need to reserve morning time for studying.
