I am writing this myself and not AI, ignore some of my mistakes. I don't want to make my brain slop by AI BRAIN ROT. ;D
I have been watching a youtube channel for a while. It's called 'Chai aur Code' and it's by a person named Hitesh Choudhary. I really like the advice he gives.
His advice has not only helped me in tech but life aswell. So he has started a cohort, Full Stack Web Development. It costs a lot, even if it had costed less, I wouldn't have purchased it either. I don't want to go into Full Stack Web Development. 

In 6 months, Hitesh and his team is going to teach their students Full Stack (meaning Front-end and Back-end both), it will take them 6 months to complete their curriculum. If they can do it, I can too, but alone.

## Then what is the challenge?
I want to learn Back-end development and DevOps, and I want to implement back-end in C++. C++ is itself a very hard programming language, I don't know how hard will it be to implement backend in C++. But I will commit to C++. Later I will learn GO programming language which is more common in backend than C++.

Challenge is that I will be a better Back-end + DevOps Engineer than anyone in their cohort after 6 months. It is a personal challenge. It is a fight with myself.
I am learning C++ from learncpp.com, I am making my networking fundamentals strong by "Data Communications and Networking with TCP/IP Protocol Suit by Behrouz Forouzan" and I have also ordered "Silberschatzs Operating System Concepts 10Ed Global Edition", how ever I understand operating systems, Linux is my strongest point, still to become a better backend engineer I should make my fundamentals very strong. I also have to learn Database, I will order that book later. 

As of Jan 2026
I have learnt all the major/basic services of AWS CLOUD from videos shared by my Late Friend Shaik Ashish. If I had money, would have cleared RHCSA. I learnt Git from 'Pro Git' book, I learnt deployment servers like tomcat/nginx/httpd from videos Shaik Ashish gave me. I learnt Sonatype Nexus (to store artifacts in remote repo) and SonarQube for code quality again from videos by Late Shaik Ashish. He was a great person and is a great soul.

I am currently learning Docker and will eventually learn other tools by reading book, lectures are slow and are designed to be easy to consume. They don't go into depths. So I am learning Docker from "Docker Deep Dive".

In 6 months, I will write another blog on 17 July 2026 to update my progress.
