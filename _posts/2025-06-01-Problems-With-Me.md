In this blog post I am going to commit this post onto GitHub with VS Code or maybe terminal as I like to take full control of things. LoL! I am also going to commit few mistakes I have been doing even though I am aware about it. Now I know Linux enough that I can feel it's a part of my soul partially, why partially? As there is always a scope of improvement. But I when I feel something is wrong with the system, by the way I am taking about my main machine and not virtual machines, I delete that OS and install a fresh one. I think I like reinstalling OS' again n again. Grass is always greener on the other side syndrome or shiny object syndrome. 

So that is one problem.

Another problem is that I know a problem and yet I don't fix that problem. Self Destruction.

I am right now make deadlines for myself and try to follow them.
My mama lives near me and he has ordered dumbells and other gym equipments. After few days they are going to arrive and hopefully I should be able to exercise with him.
