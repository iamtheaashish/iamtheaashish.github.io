## September 2025 Learnings + Recap
I had a habit of overcomplicating and overplanning things. Last 10 days I have tried to simplify goals and doing one thing at a time. And to be honest I have seen great results. So in October, I am going to repeat this same pattern. I will plan first 10 days. 

I went to Microsoft office in Gurugram on 20 September 2025 at event called Git Together. It was awesome. I really liked all the buildings and the environment of Gurugram. It had FRESH air. People at event were students (likely in their last year) and working professionals in DevOps, AI/ML, Data Science, and WebDevs. They were open to conversation and I probably was the youngest there. Even they were shocked to see me over there. But I should remember I haven't achieved anything right now, they appriciated me because I am willing to put in efforts not because I am ready with the result.

I had planned so many things to do in September that I coudn't finish one single thing completly, so october will be spent in learning few things but deeply.

We have 24 Hours in a Day, Take 8 Hours away for sleep. 16 is left, Take 4 hours away for daily chores plus exercise. We have 12 hours left them. We have to utilize these 12 hours to the fullest extent. 

My best learning this month from biographies:

1. Great people have one thing in common, they work every single waking hours of their life, they work with a special purpose in mind and they don't do that for money initially, they do it to achieve something else, for some it is satisfaction, for some it is power to be at number one in their domain. 

2. They focus on one thing at a single time, simplification and deleting unnecessary things is the key.

3. Get all the knowledge about the subject you are working with.
